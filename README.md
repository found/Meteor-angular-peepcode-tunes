# Meteor + AngularJS + peepcode tune

Hello. I wanted to learn more about meteor and also frameworks like backbone/angular because I had not worked with any of them and have been hearing good things. I decided to try and implement the peepcode tune example in just meteorJS [(Here)](https://github.com/Jonovono/Meteor-peepcode-tunes) and also in Meteor and angularJS (this project).


## Peepcode tunes
Peepcode tunes is just a demo that the peepcode screencasts go through to learn backbone.
* [Implemented in just AngularJS here](https://github.com/angular/peepcode-tunes)
* [Backbone here](https://github.com/Garren/peepcode-backbone-tunes).

It was really pleasant re creating it in Meteor with angularJS. But meteor is changing frequently so I am waiting for them to release how the api for packages will work before I make to much with it.

I use the awesome AngularJS package (unofficial) for Meteor. [(Here)](https://github.com/lvbreda/Meteor_angularjs). The author is awesome and very helpful!

## Install
I do not use meteorite. (You can try it)

1. Created a folder in /Users/me/meteor/ where I cloned the meteor project. (then when you want to run any the meteor command you type /Users/me/meteor/meteor whatever). This uses that meteor installation instead.

2. clone the angular project to /Users/me/meteor/packages.

3. Then clone this project and you should be able to do: /Users/me/meteor/meteor add angularjs (or whatever its cloned as in that directory).
